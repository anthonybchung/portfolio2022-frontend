          I still rememeber the first time I saw a computer in real life. It was
          amazing to see 2 bars moving up and down the screen. While a
          sqaure(i.e ball) bounced between them. The game was called PONG
        </p>

        <p>
          The first line of code I wrote was in BASICS on an Apple â…¡C. It was a
          simple line doing simple maths.
        </p>

        <p>
          Coding became exremely interesting when I was at university. Linking
          up the computer to i/o analog to digital chips. Working out which
          address to use. Callibrating sensors and chips, then collecting data.
        </p>

        <p>
          These experiements at university gave me a head start in the work
          force as an engineer where I directed a team of engineers in
          automating the whole wind tunnel. The software can control the fan,
          control other mechanical devices and do data analysis.
